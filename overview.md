# ---- DEPRECATED ----
This extension is now deprecated in favour of the new Chef Extension for Azure DevOps which can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chef-software.chef-azdo). The new extension allows the execution of any Chef component.

This version of the Chef Extension will not be developed or maintained. We encourage everyone to upgrade to the new extension. Documentation and migration information can be found [here](https://chef-partners.github.io/azuredevops-chef-extension).


# Chef Integration for Azure Pipelines

This [Chef](http://chef.io) integration for Azure Pipelines provides a set of tasks to automate commonly performed build and release activities when using the **[Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/)** platform.  Use these tasks to configure your servers ready for application deployment.

[Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/) provides a full suite of enterprise capabilities for workflow, visibility and compliance. Chef Automate integrates with the open-source products Chef, InSpec and Habitat.  You can create your own **Chef Automate** server by launching one from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/chef-software.chef-automate?tab=Overview).

These tasks are compatible with Chef Server 12.1 and higher.

## Build Tasks

These tasks are typically used in your Build process:

* **Update cookbook version number**: Update a cookbook version to the current build number
* **Upload cookbook to Chef Server**: Upload a cookbook to Chef Server including dependencies
* **Install ChefDK**: Install ChefDK on the build agent
* **Linting**: Perform linting tasks on the cookbook
* **Test Kitchen**: Perform TK tests on the cookbook. This is designed for the [Test Kitchen AzureRM](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-azurerm) driver which needs to be installed using the 'Install Gem' task.

## Utility Tasks

* **Install Cookbook Gems**: Install Gems for a cookbook as specified in the `Gemfile`.
* **Install Gem**: Install a Gem into the ChefDK context. Usually used to install `knife` plugins.
* **Execute Knife**: Execute Knife command with specified arguments.

## Release Tasks

These tasks are typically used as part of your Release process:

* **Add variables to Chef Environment**: Add the Azure Pipelines/TFS variables for this environment to the Chef environment
* **Release cookbook version to environment**: Releases a cookbook by releasing the cookbook constraint on the specified Chef environment
* **Install InSpec**: Install InSpec on machines in a Deployment Group
* **Execute InSpec**: Execute InSpec on machines in a Deployment Group
* **Execute Chef Client**: Execute Chef Client on machines in a Deployment Group
* **Publish Cookbook to Supermarket**: Publish the specified cookbook to the Public or a private Chef Supermarket.

## Agent Compatiblity

The following table shows the tasks and what type of agents they are compatibile with. Most of the tasks now work on Windows based agents.

| Task | Private Windows Agent | Private Linux Agent | Hosted Windows Agent | Hosted Linux Agent |
|------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Update Cookbook Version Number | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Upload Cookbook to Chef Server | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Install ChefDK | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Install Gem | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Execute Knife | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Add Variables to Chef Environment | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Release cookbook version to environment | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Install InSpec | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Excute InSpec | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Execute Chef Client | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Publish Cookbook to Supermarket | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Linting | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note:** To install ChefDK or InSpec on a Private Linux Agent then task process must be running as root or under an account that has passwordless sudo access. For a Private Windows Agent the process must be running with elevated privileges.

## Getting Started

See our guide to [Getting Started](https://github.com/chef-partners/vsts-chef/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Project Configuration/Endpoint

Before you add any Build or Release tasks to your process, you will need to configure your Chef Server "endpoint". There are 2 endpoints, one for uploading to a Chef server and the other for publishing to a Chef Supermarket.

Both of them have the same options, but allow different credentials to be used for each action.

Endpoints are a per-project configuration and can be accessed via **Project Settings** (cog) > **Services**

The Chef Server endpoint let's you securely store the following information:

* Chef Server URL - URL to the Chef Server including the organization, e.g. `https://mychefserver.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/organizations/myorg`
* Username (Node name) - A username on the Chef server that has admin permissions
* Client key - The private key (in pem format) for the specified user
* SSL Verification - Enables/disables the SSL certificate verification for the Chef Server.  Set to `false` if you are using self-signed certificates.  Default: `true` (Chef Server certificate must be signed by a valid Certificate Authority)
